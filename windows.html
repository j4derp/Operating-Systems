            <div class="info-section">
                <h2> Video and Expansion Types</h2>
<p>Expansion cards expand a computer's functionality or increase its performance. Expansion cards install into the expansion slot on a motherboard. Expansion bus standards define communication specifications as well as physical characteristics of expansion cards and slots.</p>   
             <p>Video cards process graphical information for output to an external display. The quality and speed have increased dramatically with PC gaming and cryptocurrency mining. A device called a capture card is growing in use to support streaming and the recording games and videos.</p>

                 <div class="feature-list">
                <h2>Peripheral Component Interconnect</h2>            
<p>PCI was developed to replace the obsolete Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) and (Video Electronic Standards Association) VESA bus standards. PCI:</p>             
                  <ul>
<li>Is processor independent, meaning the CPU and PCI bus can process concurrently.</li>
<li>Supports plug-and-play, meaning installed devices are detected and configured automatically.</li>
<li>Is commonly used by devices such as sound cards, modems, network cards, and storage device controllers.</li>
<li>Can run at 33 MHz and transfer data at 133 MBps or run at 66 MHz and transfer data at 266 MBps.</li>
              </ul>
       <h2>Legacy buses</h2>
                  <p>	Buses that have been replaced by newer types are considered legacy buses. Legacy buses are rarely used and include the following:</p>
                  <ul>
<li>AGP is a dedicated bus type used by dedicated video cards.</li>
<li>Audio/modem riser (AMR) is a riser card that attaches to the motherboard and allows additional cards (called daughter cards) to be installed.</li>
<li>Communications network riser (CNR) is a riser card slot that allows for installing network, sound, or modem functions.</li>
                   
                  </ul>
                 <h2>Intergrated and Dedicated Video Cards</h2>
    <p>You can implement video cards as a dedicated expansion board or integrated with other components.</p>
        <p>Integrated video cards:</p>
                  <ul>
<li>Integrate the graphics processing unit (GPU) with another hardware component (e.g., the central processing unit (CPU) or motherboard).</li>
<li>Share system memory for graphic processing.</li>
<li>Are less expensive than dedicated video cards, but are also less powerful.</li>
<li>Are installed in most pre-built PCs and found in most laptops. Integrated cards are also used in servers.</li>  
                  </ul>
        <p>Dedicated video cards:</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>Are installed in an expansion slot on the motherboard.</li>
<li>Have a GPU and a dedicated, high-speed video memory bank.</li>
<li>Are more powerful than most integrated video cards, but are also more expensive.</li>
<li>Are used in cryptocurrency mining.</li>
<li>Allow multiple cards to be connected. This is called daisy chaining.</li>
                  </ul>
