     <h3>What is an operating system (OS)?</h3>
    <p>An operating system is a set of programs that act as an interface between the applications that are running on a computer and the computer's hardware.</p>

  <h3>What are four of the most common operating systems?</h3>
     <br>🌐--Windows
     <br>🌐--Linux

<h3>What is the difference between a proprietary and an open-source operating system?</h3>

<p>The difference between these two is that proprietary operating systems 
 are developed and owned by a company, so you can't access or modify their source code. On the other hand, open-source operating systems are 
 freely available to use, modify, and distribute.</p>
